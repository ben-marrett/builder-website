## Template Conversion Recommendations

### Framework Development
1. **Core Framework Structure**
   ```
   core/
   ├── components/     # Base reusable components
   ├── layouts/        # Common layout patterns
   ├── themes/         # Configurable color schemes
   ├── features/       # Optional plug-and-play modules
   └── starters/       # Industry-specific templates
   ```

2. **Configuration System**
   - Create site-wide config for easy customization:
     ```typescript
     export interface SiteConfig {
       business: {
         name: string;
         contact: ContactInfo;
         social: SocialLinks;
       };
       theme: {
         colors: ColorScheme;
         fonts: Typography;
       };
       features: {
         beforeAfter: boolean;
         testimonials: boolean;
         blog: boolean;
       };
     }
     ```
