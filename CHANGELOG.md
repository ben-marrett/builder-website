# Project Updates & Learnings

## Recent Improvements

### Data Management
- Consolidated project data by using `projects.ts` as single source of truth
- Added `shortDescription` to projects for homepage previews
- Removed duplicate project data from HomePage component

### UI/UX Enhancements
1. Hero Section
   - Updated hero image to better reflect local builder focus
   - Improved text visibility with white color and shadow
   - Enhanced mobile responsiveness with better text scaling
   - Added semi-transparent overlay (bg-stone-900/20) for better contrast

2. Call-to-Action Buttons
   - Primary: White background with dark text for maximum visibility
   - Secondary: Semi-transparent dark background (bg-stone-900/40) with white border
   - Improved mobile layout with stacked buttons
   - Added proper spacing and padding

3. Gallery Integration
   - Updated featured projects to match gallery images
   - Using project.afterImage URLs consistently

## Potential Improvements Needed

1. Code Organization
   - Consider moving button styles to shared components
   - Create consistent button variants (primary/secondary) for reuse

2. Type Safety
   - Add TypeScript interfaces for project data structure
   - Consider creating typed constants for image dimensions

3. Performance
   - Review and optimize image loading strategies
   - Consider lazy loading for gallery images

4. Accessibility
   - Add proper ARIA labels to buttons
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios
   - Add alt text for images

5. Testing
   - Add tests for new project data integration
   - Test responsive layouts

## Key Problems Solved

1. **Data Consistency**: Eliminated duplicate project data
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Improved hero section layout across devices
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Better distinction between primary/secondary CTAs
4. **Content Visibility**: Enhanced text and button contrast against background
