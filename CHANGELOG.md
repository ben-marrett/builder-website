   - Using project.afterImage URLs consistently

4. Fixed featuredProjectImages implementation in HomePage

## Potential Improvements Needed

1. Code Organization
   - Consider moving button styles to shared components
   - Create consistent button variants (primary/secondary) for reuse

2. Type Safety
   - Add TypeScript interfaces for project data structure
   - Consider creating typed constants for image dimensions

3. Performance
   - Review and optimize image loading strategies
   - Consider lazy loading for gallery images

4. Accessibility
   - Add proper ARIA labels to buttons
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios
   - Add alt text for images

5. Testing
   - Add tests for new project data integration
   - Test responsive layouts

6. Move remaining hardcoded data to centralized files (services in HomePage)

## Key Problems Solved

1. **Data Consistency**: Eliminated duplicate project data
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Improved hero section layout across devices
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Better distinction between primary/secondary CTAs
4. **Content Visibility**: Enhanced text and button contrast against background 
5. **Type Safety Improvements**: Fixed type safety across components
6. **Centralized Data Management**: Created centralized data files for services, team members, and testimonials

## Issues to address

1. **Button Inconsistency** ✅
- Issue: Multiple button styles are defined in different places
- Solution: Created reusable `Button` component with variants
- Status: Implemented and being used across all pages

2. **Duplicate Call-to-Action Sections**
- Issue: The same CTA section appears in multiple pages
- Solution: Create a reusable `CTASection` component

3. **Type Safety Improvements** ✅
- Issue: Missing TypeScript interfaces for data structures
- Solution: Added interfaces for projects, services, testimonials
- Status: Implemented across all data files

4. **Accessibility Issues** (Partially Addressed ✓)
- ✅ Fixed ARIA attributes for radio buttons
- ✅ Removed redundant ARIA roles
- ⏳ Still needed:
  - Review and enhance image alt texts
  - Add skip navigation links
  - Implement keyboard navigation for gallery
  - Add focus management for modals

5. **Performance Considerations**
- Large images could benefit from proper sizing and loading strategies
- Consider lazy loading for gallery images
- Add loading states for image-heavy sections

6. **Code Organization** (Partially Addressed ✓)
- ✅ Created shared Button component
- ✅ Moved types to centralized location
- ⏳ Still needed:
  - Create layouts folder for shared layouts
  - Create constants file for repeated values

7. **Testing Gaps**
- Missing tests for new project data integration
- Need tests for responsive layouts
- Add more comprehensive component testing

8. **Contact Form Implementation**
- Need to implement Netlify Forms attributes
- Add proper form validation
- Add loading and success states

9. **SEO Enhancements** (New)
- Add structured data (JSON-LD) for business information
- Implement breadcrumbs navigation
- Add XML sitemap
- Add meta descriptions for each page

10. **Animation and Interaction** (Partially Addressed ✓)
- ✅ Restored contact page animations
- ⏳ Still needed:
  - Add loading states for interactive elements
  - Implement reduced motion preferences
  - Add hover/focus states for interactive elements
